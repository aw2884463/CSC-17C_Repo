We can see in the operational analysis that at about 57 elements being sorted the operation count for the modified selection sort surpasses merge sort.
So merge sort can sort the entire array more efficently than our modified selection sort can sort 57 elements. 

Changing the size of p does change our anlaysis.
Modified selection sort O(p*n)  but as p>>n O(n^2)
